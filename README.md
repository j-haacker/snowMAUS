# snowMAUS

snowMAUS is a simple model that calculates the amounts of snowfall and meltwater
production based on the precipitation and the minimum and maximum temperatures.
The model was introduced in Agricultural and Forest Meteorology Issue 150, 2010,
by M. Trnka and others: "Simple snow cover model for agrometeorological
applications". This repository offers a python implementation of the model.
